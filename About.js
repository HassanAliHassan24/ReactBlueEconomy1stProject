        A Conversation with Aboud Jumbe, Principal Secretary of Zanzibar’s Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries</span>

    <p >The Blue Economy, according to the World Bank, is the sustainable use of resources for economic growth, improved <br /> 
        livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health. In Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous island state off the coast of <br /> 
         mainland Tanzania, ocean-based activities contribute over 29% to GDP and 33% of its labor force, while tourism <br />
          accounts for another 30% of its GDP. Additionally, 98% of Zanzibar’s foreign trade is maritime-based.  <br />
          <p />
        <p />
        <p />
        <p />
      <br/>
      <br/>

          
        Sustainable development and management of the Blue Economy, therefore, is crucial for Zanzibar’s present and  <br /> 
        future. As a whole, Tanzania is now making strides towards mainstreaming ocean governance and blue economy in  <br />
         the national development agenda. The Nairobi Convention Secretariat sat down with the first-ever Principal Secretary <br />
         of the newly established Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries of Zanzibar, Aboud Jumbe (formerly the Alternate  <br />
         Focal Point of Tanzania to the Nairobi Convention) to discuss how the Ministry is setting out to realize the island’s full <br />
         Blue Economy potential. </p>

    <h3> Q:Why, in your opinion, is the Blue Economy so important?</h3>
    <br />
    A: Globally, we know that 35-40% of the world’s population live within 100 km of the coast.<br />
 Fisheries account for 15% of global protein intake. 90% of international trade is conducted by sea.<br />
 50% of the major tourist trips globally are beach destinations. Major cities around the world are<br />
 built by coastal areas.  <br />
The concept of the Blue Economy sprung up because we know today what we didn’t know<br />
 yesterday – i.e., that the ocean is not well. A balancing act needs to be struck between harvesting<br />
 the ocean in an accelerated but sustainable manner while investing more in its protection. <br />
Blue economy approaches can create opportunities for coastal populations that transform<br />
 livelihoods while being compatible with their cultural heritage and systems. These approaches can<br />
 also help address gender equality and promote social inclusion.  <br />
Furthermore, the Blue Economy is so important in Zanzibar also because of how much is included<br />
 under its umbrella – there’s small-scale fisheries and aquaculture, but also deep sea fishing,<br />
 tourism, a potential for offshore renewable energy, and ongoing exploration activities on oil and<br />
 gas. Nowadays, there are even more efforts by Tanzania to engage marine scientific research and<br />
 equitable benefit sharing, bioprospecting, enhancing port infrastructure, and mechanizing industrial<br />
 processing facilities for fisheries and aquaculture, etc.   <br />

        <h2>Q: Can you tell us a little more about the establishment of Zanzibar’s <br />
             Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries?</h2>
             <p></p>
             <p></p>
             <br />

            <p></p> A: Although Tanzania has, in the recent past, been charting a new strategic direction towards ocean
<br/>

 governance, the Blue Economy push really gained momentum during Zanzibar’s last presidential<br/>

 election campaign in 2020. During the election, our president [Dr. Hussein Ali Mwinyi] took a big,<br/>

 historic risk by putting the Blue Economy Agenda at the center of his election campaign. I don’t<br/>

 recall any other politician from anywhere else in the region ever doing this. The president’s<br/>

 message was that, as a small island, Zanzibar’s fate – its destiny – would depend on us capitalizing<br/>

 on our ocean resources. This transformation would need to be based on a blending of our<br/>

 traditional maritime heritage with a modern structural transformation of our economy through<br/>

 strong ocean governance.  
After his election, President Mwinyi immediately started to implement <br/>these commitments. He<br/>

 established the first-ever Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries, with two key foci – 1)<br/>

 empowering local people to let them see the true value of embracing the Blue Economy; and 2)<br/>

 accelerating structural transformation of Zanzibar’ economy through bankable and sustainable<br/>

 investments for the Blue Economy. Today, the name President Mwinyi is synonymous with the<br/>

 Blue Economy Agenda in Zanzibar and in Tanzania as whole. The President is not only recognized<br/>


 as the new Blue Economy Champion in the regional bloc, but also carries the torch for the global<br/>
 He-for-She Campaign.

        A: Conventional statistics systems are not necessarily compatible with measuring the Blue
    <br/>
    
     Economy. Though we have conventional data on fisheries, taxes, imports/exports, etc., we must do
    <br/>
    
     more to address the whole context of marine natural capital and capture the potential of the oceans.
    <br/>
    
     This will help investors decide whether an investment is worth the risk, and it’s a challenge. UNDP
    <br/>
    
     is partnering with the Tony Blair Institute to help us build a Blue Economy delivery system,
    <br/>
    
     establishing strategic priorities and bankable projects. These will require a Blue Economy
    <br/>
    
     dashboard that will standardize this data delivery. Already, UNDP, WIOMSA and other partners
    <br/>
    
     have come forth to show willingness to support the delivery systems. 
    We’re also working with Sustainable Seas <br/> Trust on how to develop marine litter and plastic waste
    <br/>
    
     data indicators and related ‘towards-zero-plastic-waste science-to-policy’ platforms for the Blue
    <br/>
    
     Economy. We want a system that, for instance, warns us about environmental hazards like marine
    <br/>
    
     pollution – but at the same time measures the progress we’ve made to ameliorate this issue. I’m
    <br/>
    
     confident that we will soon have these data systems up and running.
